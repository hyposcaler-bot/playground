# EDA Playground

We made sure that trying EDA is as easy as running a single command. Literally.

The Makefile that comes with this repository has everything that is needed to enact the working EDA setup with pre-configured data and a simulated network. We call this the "Playground".

Read more about using the playground at [docs.eda.dev](https://docs.eda.dev/getting-started/try-eda/).
